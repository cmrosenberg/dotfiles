### About

This repo hosts my various dotfiles. I intend to keep things simple, unobtrusive,
and easily extendible where needed.

### How to install

Each program has its own folder of configuration files. Simply make a
symbolic link from your home directory to  what you are interested in.
For example, to use the vimrc:

```shell
username@box:~$ ln -s /path/to/repo/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
