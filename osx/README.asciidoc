OS X: General Installation Notes
--------------------------------

When installing a vanilla OS X installation, the following is
nice to keep in mind.

General Applications that need to be installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* http://iterm2.com/[iTerm 2]
* https://www.virtualbox.org/[Virtualbox]
* https://www.vagrantup.com/[Vagrant]

Homebrew applications that need to be installed
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It should be obvious, but note that the following packages
have a variety of dependencies that also will be installed.

* `ack`
* `binutils`
* `cloc`
* `colordiff`
* `coreutils`
* `cscope`
* `curl`
* `findutils`
* `git` (use the git in XCode Toolchain to bootstrap homebrew)
* `macvim` (alias `vim` to the vim-binary held within for a fresh vim)
* `node`
* `pwgen`
* `reattach-to-user-namespace` (a hack that makes `tmux` work properly)
* `tig`
* `tmux`
* `wget`
* `zsh`

Misc
~~~~

* Be sure to grab the https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized[Solarized Theme] for iTerm.
* Also, get http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html[Inconsolata], a very nice font for programmers.
* I recommend setting the following aliases:
    ** `alias ls="ls -G"`
    ** `alias diff='colordiff'`
