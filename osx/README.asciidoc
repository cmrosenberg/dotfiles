OS X: General Installation Notes

When installing a vanilla OS X installation, the following is
nice to keep in mind.

It should be obvious, but note that the following packages
have a variety of dependencies that also will be installed.

* `ack`
* `binutils`
* `cloc`
* `colordiff`

* `git` (use the git in XCode Toolchain to bootstrap homebrew)
* `vim`
* `macvim`
* `node`
* `pwgen`
* `reattach-to-user-namespace` (a hack that makes `tmux` work properly)

Configuring iTerm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Be sure to grab the https://github.com/altercation/solarized/tree/master/iterm2-colors-solarized[Solarized Theme] for iTerm.
* I've had some problems with locale discrepancies between OS X and Linux.
As of today, my approach to this problem is to turn off
"Set locale variables automatically" in iTerm > Preferences > Terminal and set
`export LC_CTYPE="en_US.UTF-8"` in my `.zshrc`.


Misc
~~~~

* One of the first things I like to do is to "Automatically hide
and show the dock".

* I also like to throw away all the OSX apps from the Dock.
I never use them.

* I've learned the hard way that you should always install
all of XCode, not just the command line utilities.

* Another thing I dislike about Apple's standard setup is that
it is so hard to find the home folder in Finder. I fix this by opening
a terminal, going to the parent of ~, issuing ´open .´ and then dragging
the icon for the home-filder into the left-side margin.

* It's worth spending some time tweaking Finder. I like to set it
to always search the current directory, and remove the tags: I never
use them.

* Make sure to get http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html[Inconsolata], a very nice font for programmers.

* I recommend setting the following aliases:
    ** `alias ls="ls -G"` (You probably don't want to set this on Linux!)
    ** `alias diff='colordiff'`
